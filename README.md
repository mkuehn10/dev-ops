------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Description

In this course you will learn the key principles of Dev-Ops including collaboration, automation, testing, and reproducibility. We will learn common workflows for CI/CD, environment management, package management, containerization, monitoring & logging, and version control. Participants will get hands-on experience with a variety of tools that may include Docker, Github Actions, and APIs.

Please note that this course is not prescriptive around Dev-Ops tools which are constantly growing and changing. Given that, the exact tools that will be used in this course (e.g. Jenkins, Azure Devops, etc) are subject to change.

Course examples will be provided in both R and Python. In addition, some sections and exercises will utilize bash scripting, YAML, and the command line. Participants are encouraged to use the programming language of their choice.

## Audience

This course is for you if you:

-   Want to learn the main principles and tools of DevOps .

-   Are a data scientist who wants to put their R or Python code into production or work more closely with DevOps teams.

-   Want to get hands-on experience using CI/CD tools and other Dev-Ops workflows.

The course will **not cover** the following:

-   How to become a Dev-Ops engineer

-   In-depth security or networking practices

-   Cloud-specific tools (especially pay-walled ones)

-   How to write R or Python code
